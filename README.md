# Learning C Language

## C language was developed by **Dennis Ritchie** in the year 1972 at bell labs

C is primarily a Procedural language

It blends the combination of low-level Language and High-Level Language. And C is called Middle level language

**MinGW GNU gcc , gcc++ compiler i have installed for C**

**include<stdio.h>  It is a preprocessor directive**

Boilerplate code it is the bare minimum standard code that is required almost in every C program

Variables is a container which stores a value

Datatypes:

- Integer  1,2,6,7
- float 3.2,7.0
- Character  'zee','$'

C is the fast language to adopt its culture very fast, and its a very prominent language among Python, Java.
Latency is very important in Programming language.

**Data type defines what kind of data**

**Variable is where that data is stored**

Basic Datatypes supported in C;
Three types of Data-Types
 - Primitive datatypes (int, float, char, void, double)
 - Derived Data types (array, pointers, function)
 - User Defined Data types (Enum, Structure, union)

printf() It is used to display the inserted data on the console after running the program.
scanf() reads input from standard input (keyboard) and stores it into variables,

 - %d → format specifier for integer
 - &age → address of variable age 
- scanf() stores the entered value into age

**Why & (ampersand) is used? (in scanf)
scanf() needs the memory address of the variable
& gives the address of a variable**

Common Format Specifiers
**DataType	Format**
int	         %d
float	     %f
double	     %lf
char	     %c
string	     %s
